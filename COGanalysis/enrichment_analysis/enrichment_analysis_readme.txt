Analysis of enrichment among differentially regulated genes of COG categories using fisher exact test.

Use script = enrichment_test_Firm5_RNAseq.R

Input = summary files obtained with COG analysis. 

Example input = 183_invivo_down_COGs_summary.txt

And files containing COG information for each genome:

183_all_COGs.txt
184_all_COGs.txt
185_all_COGs.txt
186_all_COGs.txt
